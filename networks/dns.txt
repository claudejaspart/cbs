-- DNS --

* Domain Name System

* Domain hierarchy :
  * Root Domain (.)
    * Top-Level Domain (.com, .fr, ...)
      * Second Level Domain (any site .com, any site .fr ...)
        * Subdomain

* 2 types of TLD :
  * Generic Top Level (gTLD)
  * Country Code Top Level (ccTLD)
* Over 2000 TLDs

* Second-level domain limited to 63 chars
* Only a-z 0-9 and hyphens. Connot start/end with an hyphen, no consecutive hyphens.

* Subdomain separated on the left with a period. Ex : admin.tryhackme.com
* Subdomain name has the same restrictions as the the second-level domain name.
* Can concat multiple subdomains but total length must not exceed 253 chars.
* No limit to the number of subdomains.

* DNS not just for websites. Multiples types of DNS exists :
  * A Record : resolve to IPv4 addresses
  * AAAA Record  : resolve to IPv6 addresses
  * CNAME Record : resolve to another domain name. Ex : store.tryhackme.com returns a CNAME record 
                   shops.shopify.com
  * MX Record    : resolve to the address of the servers that handle the emails. These records come a 
                   priority flag to indicate in which order to try the servers. 
  * TXT Record   : free text fields that can have multiple uses, but some common ones can be to list
                   servers that have authority to send email on behalf of the domain. Also used to
                   verify the ownership of the domain name when signing up for third party services.

* What happens when you make a DNS request (each step if not found) :
  * Computer checks first the hosts file
  * Computer then checks the local cache
  * Computer sends a request to the Recursive DNS Server provided by the ISP
  * Computer sends a request to the root server, then forwards to TLD server, then to an authoritative server

* DNS records come with a TTL (Time To Live) value in seconds, and is saved locally in the cache.

* Location of the hosts file :
  * Windows : C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts
  * Mac     : /private/etc/hosts (go to finder > go > go to finder)
  * Linux   : /etc/hosts
